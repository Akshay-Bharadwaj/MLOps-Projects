# 🧠 Profit Predictor using Linear Regression

## 📘 Project Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict a company’s **profit** based on its **spending patterns** (R&D, Administration, Marketing) and **geographical location (State)**.  
It is an end-to-end **beginner-friendly ML project** covering **data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and model deployment using Pickle and FastAPI**.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** `50_Startups.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `R&D Spend` – Investment in research and development  
  - `Administration` – Administrative expenses  
  - `Marketing Spend` – Marketing expenditure  
  - `State` – Categorical variable indicating company location  
- **Target:** `Profit`

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. Importing Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import pickle
```
**Why these libraries?**
- `pandas` & `numpy`: Data manipulation and numerical computations  
- `scikit-learn`: Preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation  
- `pickle`: For saving and reloading the trained model efficiently

---

### 2. Data Loading & Exploration
```python
data = pd.read_csv("50_Startups.csv")
data.info()
```
- Verified no missing or null values.  
- Understood data structure (5 columns).

---

### 3. Feature–Label Separation
```python
features = data.iloc[:, [0,1,2,3]].values
label = data.iloc[:, [4]].values
```
Separated:
- **Features:** Input variables (spending + location)  
- **Label:** Output variable (profit)

---

### 4. Handling Categorical Data (One-Hot Encoding)
`State` is a categorical column, so numerical encoding was needed.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
oheState = OneHotEncoder(sparse_output=False)
stateDummy = oheState.fit_transform(data.iloc[:, [3]])
```
- One-Hot Encoding creates binary dummy columns for each category.  
- Prevents giving a false ordinal relationship to categorical data.  
- Concatenated the encoded columns with numerical features to form the final input dataset.

---

### 5. Train–Test Split and Model Training
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(finalFeatureSet, label, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- Dataset split into **80% training** and **20% testing**.  
- **Linear Regression** model fits a line minimizing the sum of squared errors between predicted and actual profit values.

---

### 6. Model Evaluation using Train & Test Scores
```python
train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score  = model.score(X_test, y_test)
```
- **Train Score:** Measures how well the model fits the training data.  
- **Test Score:** Measures how well the model generalizes to unseen data.  

---

### 7. Understanding CL and SL

- **SL** (*Significance Level*) - How much uncertainty you’re willing to accept  
- **CL** (*Confidence Level*) - How sure you are that your result is correct  

CL = 1 - SL

---

### 8. Model Serialization with Pickle
After training the final model:
```python
pickle.dump(model, open('ProfitPredictor.pkl', 'wb'))
```
Later, reload it for deployment or predictions:
```python
pickle.load(open('ProfitPredictor.pkl', 'rb'))
```
Pickle ensures the model can be reused without retraining, making deployment faster.

---

## 🧰 API Deployment (FastAPI + Docker + Kubernetes)

### 🐍 FastAPI App (`main.py`)
The model is deployed using **FastAPI**, allowing real-time predictions via REST API.

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /` → Health check  
- `POST /predict` → Accepts query parameters and returns predicted profit  

**Example Request (Query Parameters):**
```
POST /predict?rdSpend=150000&adSpend=120000&marSpend=300000&state=California
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{"Predicted Profit": 187000.45}
```

> **Note:** Input parameters are passed as **query parameters** in the URL, not JSON body.  
> Valid states: `California`, `Florida`, `New York`.

---

### 🐳 Docker Setup

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

**Build and Run:**
```bash
docker build -t profit-predictor .
docker run -p 8000:8000 profit-predictor
```

---

### ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment

**deploy.yml** includes:
- Deployment (2 replicas)
- LoadBalancer Service exposing port 80 → 8000

Apply with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy.yml
```

If it is to be run locally (without a cloud LoadBalancer), port-forwarding is used to access the API:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/profit-pred-api 3000:80 --address=0.0.0.0
```

To access via browser or API client at:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
